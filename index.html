                <h1>Walt Disney's Box Office Movie Data Analysis</h1>

                Founded in the early 1920s, The Walt Disney Company has released hundreds of movies in a wide range of genres and although directed towards a younger audience, their movies still captivate persons of all different ages. <br><br>
                We will go through the data analyze trends in Disney movies and how movies have changed over the decades. 
                <br><br>
                <b>On the right, you will see a dot plot of the top movies and its received gross income received in dollars.</b> <br><br>

                <span class="helper-text">You can hover over any bubble to reveal more information in the form of a tooltip at any time.</span> <br><br>

                To your right, you will see each movie clustered by genre of which there are 12 categories. In the data set, there are
                some missing values for the genre, these are encoded which the teal color as shown in the legend. The size of the bubble
                represents the proportion in terms of total gross income received from the movie. In this visualization, we can deduce at 
                first glance that Disney has created many comedy and action movies. The action movies seem to generally garner an above-average
                total gross revenue. <br><br>

                Conversely, there seems to have been a lot of comedies and dramas released, but as shown the size of the bubbles are smaller. <br><br>
                Some questions that we might have right now, though, is how this gross income relates in terms of inflation. Also, how about the amount
                of time it takes for a certian movie to be produced? Intuitively, a drama or comedy movie might require much less resource to produce
                than an epic action movie. Unfortunately, this data set is limited and we may only be able to answer some of these questions.

                <p>First, we can take a look at the overall picture of gross income received over the decades starting from the late 1930's all they way
                    to 2015. On the y axis, we have the total gross income that Disney received from movies that year. </p>

                <p>However, we should make some adjustments when it comes to inflation. In this graph, we can see the adjusted gross income
                    per year. Here, yellow area indicates the adjusted gross income while the green is the regular total gross income.</p>

            <section class='step'><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <p>We can then overlap the two graphs to compare the total gross income versus the total adjusted gross income.</p>

            <section class='step'>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, we can view the total income (adjusted for inflation) by each genre over the years. You can use the select-able dropdown   
                    to select different genres to view.

                <p>
                    We can also explore the number of movies released by genre over the decades as well. Similarly to the previous chart, 
                    you can also select using the drop down which specific genre you wish to explore.

                <p>
                    In this bar chart, we can see that adventure clearly is the most lucrative that Disney releases. This category envelops many very high budget movies such as Star Wars VII
                    Finding Nemo, The Jungle Book, Toy Story, and other classics. <br><br>
                    However, we must take into account that most movies in the adventure category have a very high budget and require a lot of time to produce. For example, Star Wars VII grossed $940 million
                    (adjusted for inflation) and the film's conception was back around 2012. On January 2013, they named directors. The script took about a year, and filming began in 2014. The film was released at the end of 2015. 
                    This was nearly a 3-4 year process. <br><br>
                    If we contrast this with a comedy movie like Freaky Friday ($150 million, adjusted for inflation), the movie was wrapped up within about 1-2 years. <br><br>
                    The question begs, which movie genre gives the higher rate of return and the fastest?

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on our analysis, it seems like Disney heavily focuses their box office movie releases to three main genres: Adventure, Comedy, and Action. 
                    Within the last decade or so, a good majority if Disney's income coming from movies come from Action and Adventure movies. Although the production, filming,
                    post-production, editing, etc. may be much more extensive than movies in other genres, the amount of income these titles receive outweigh the time it takes to make
                    them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With limited data, we are limited in the conclusions we can make. Some next steps would be to scrap or collect data on time to create specific titles, and create 
                    additional visualizations that involve specific actors, directors, writers, etc.
